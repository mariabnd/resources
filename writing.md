# Resources for writing

## Phrasing
* [United Nations Guidelines for gender-inclusive language in English](https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml)
* [European Union Interinstitutional Style Guide](https://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-000100.htm) useful for country names
* Use *adherence* or *concordance* rather than *compliance* when discussing uptake of treatment (suggested in From Chaos to Coercion)
* Follow the epidemiologic equivalent to the Bender rule -- always state the location being investigated
* [The Health Foundation style guide](https://www.health.org.uk/publications/write-right)

### Specific suggestions to avoid confusion in time when communicating to others (particularly AmEng speakers)

* Use *fortnightly* to mean every fourteen days and *semiweekly* to mean twice a week. Avoid *biweekly*
* Use *biennial* to mean every two years and *biannual* **only** to mean twice a year
* Avoid use of *quite*; Americans think it's an amplifier and will misunderstand. Instead use *rather* when amplifying

## Readibility

Remember to left-align text for readibility (here I disagree with *Trees, Maps, and Theorems*). For LaTeX add
```
\usepackage{ragged2e}
\setlength{\RaggedRightParindent}{\parindent}
```
to the preamble and
```
\RaggedRight
```
after `\begin{document}

## Miscellaneous

The Journal of Clinical Epidemiology has a [Writing Tips series](https://jclinepi.com/content/jce-Writing-Tips-Series) NB the authorship one mentioned only ICMJE and [CReDIT](https://casrai.org/credit/) is more inclusive to e.g. research engineers
