# Research resources

Some resources that come in useful when doing research-related tasks

* [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org)
* [Catalogue of biases](https://catalogofbias.org/biases)

## How I structure my .bib files (personal preference)

* Ordered alphabetically by key
* Key given as FirstAuthorYear-DOI where DOI available e.g. `Gsell2017-10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30541-8`
* List all authors names where possible (sometimes citing software hampers this with use of `others`)
* Use `~` as spacing when authors have multiple first initials, e.g. `Smith, V.~T.`
* Use curly brackets when authors have double surnames, e.g. `Jones-Layton, P.`
